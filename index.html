# Introduction

- Adult L2 learners have persistent difficulties acquiring inflectional morphology (Slabakova, 2008)

--

  - Deficit and accessibility models 
  
--

.pull-left[

- **Deficit Models**: claim that late bilinguals cannot acquire grammatical features that are absent in their L1 after a critical period 
]

--

.pull-right[
- **Accessibility Models**: claim that late bilinguals can acquire representation and computation that is qualitatively comparable to native grammars 
]


---
# L2 Morphosyntactic Processing 

- Mounting evidence of effects of language experience on acquisition and processing
- In terms of sensitivity to agreement violations: 
  - Lower proficiency speakers = **not sensitive** (Jiang, 2004, 2007; Marinis et al., 2005; Dehaene et al., 1997; Perani et al., 1996)
  - Intermediate = **sensitive** (Sagarra &amp; Herschensohn, 2010)
  - High proficiency = **sensitive** (Jackson, 2008; Jackson &amp; Dussias, 2009; Kaan, Ballantyne &amp; Wijnen, 2015; Song, 2015; Peranie et al., 1998; Vingerhoets et al., 2003)
      
- L2 learners can develop processing patterns that are qualitatively similar to those of native speakers, but are not quantitatively identical 

---

# HS Morphosyntactic Processing

.pull-left[
- Offline studies have yielded mixed results:
  - *HS &gt; L2* learners in production tasks and grammaticality tasks (Håkansson, 1995; Montrul et al., 2008; Bowles, 2011, McDonald, 2000)
    - *HS &gt; L2* learners in oral than written production tasks &amp; measures of implicit knowledge 
  - *HS = L2* learners in production tasks including oral narratives and GJT (Au et al., 2002; Knightley et al., 2003)
]
--
.pull-right[
- Online studies are also inconclusive: 
  - Some studies show *differences* (HS &gt; L2) (Hernandez, Hofman, and Kotz, 2007; Bosch, Veríssimo, and Clahsen, 2019; Wartenburger et al., 2003)
  - Other show *no differences* between L2ers &amp; HS (Foote, 2008; Rodríguez and Reglero, 2015)
]

# Subject-Verb Agreement


## Spanish 

- A pro-drop language that is morphologically rich with many verbal inflections
- Subject and number are encoded in that verbal morphology

--

![](libs/img/img1.png)

---
# Subject-Verb Agreement (cont.)

## English 

- Is not as morphologically rich, with the exception of the simple present tense 


![](libs/img/img2.png)

- Weak agreement features, cannot license null-subjects, requires explicit subjects
- L2 learners have to acquire strong morphological features, which may cause a real-time processing difficulty 


---

# Processing of SV number agreement in L2 learners 

- Offline studies: 
  - Cross-linguistic influence and proficiency play a role in production of SV number agreement (Jackson, Mormer, and Brehm, 2018)
- Online studies show effects of:
      - L1 transfer &amp; L2 Proficiency (Jiang, 2004; Chen, Shau, Liu, Zhao, &amp; Li, 2007; Yao and Chen, 2017; Sagarra, 2014)
      - Immersion experience effects (Sagarra &amp; LaBrozzi, 2018)
      - Task effects (Hopp, 2013)
      
      
---

# Processing of SV number agreement in HS 


- Foote (2008): non-cumulative word-by-word self-paced reading task 
    - Advanced HS and L2ers
    - 2 experiments:
      - 1st: only monolinguals were sensitive 
      - 2nd: all groups were sensitive, sensitivity more present with adjacent vs non-adjacent agreement
    - Limitations: No filler sentences, not counterbalanced and a larger native control in first experiment; second experiment all bilinguals were Spanish instructors


- Rodríguez &amp; Reglero (2015): non-cumulative word-by-word self-paced reading task 
    - Low-to-intermediate and advanced HS &amp; L2ers
    - No significant differences (both sensitive at V+2)
    - Limitations: no control of person type, used a battery of t-tests and a one-way ANOVA instead of a GLM or GLMM

# Present Study

## Goal: 

- The current study aims to explore the effects of AoA and proficiency on the morphosyntactic processing of HS and L2 learners
- Implements eye-tracking methdology for a reading task with adjacent SV agreement

---
# Research Questions: 

##### RQ1 : Does AoA modulate or provide an advantage for HS over L2 learners processing of SV number agreement in Spanish? 

--
- Expect both HS and L2 learners to acquire morphosyntactic processing patterns that are qualitatively comparable to Spanish monolinguals
  - (Dowens et al., 2010; Sagarra &amp; Herschensohn, 2010; Sagarra, 2014; Sagarra &amp; LaBrozzi, 2018)
- Expect AoA to be predictive of sensitivity to SV agreement violations in Spanish
  - (Håkansson, 1995; Montrul et al., 2008; McDonald, 2000, Bowles, 2011)


##### RQ2: Does proficiency modulate morphosyntactic processing patterns of SV number agreement?

--
- Expect both higher proficiency L2 and HS to able to attain monolingual-like morphosyntactic processing, while the lower proficiency L2 and HS will not. 
   - (Hoshino et al., 2010; Sagarra, 2014; Jiang, 2004)

# Materials and Procedure

- Informed Consent Form
- Language Background Questionnaire (5 min)
  - Questions about language experience and exposure
- DELE Proficiency Test (10-20 min)
  - 56-item multiple choice test measuring grammatical knowledge and reading comprehension
- Eye-tracking task (20-40 min)
- Vocabulary test (10 min)
  - Assessment of familiarity with the experimental nouns and verbs

---

# Materials and Procedure
#### Eye-tracking Task

- Participants completed a reading eye-tracking task.
  - See a fixation point, a sentence appears
  - Look at the gray box, the sentence disappears and is replaced with four pictures
  - They were instructed to click on the picture that best matches the sentence.

# Eye-tracking Task (cont)

- 85 sentence experiment 
  - 5 practice sentences, 16 experimental (8 per condition, 64 distractors)
  - Break after 40 
  - Sentences were distributed in blocks following a Latin square design
- All sentences followed the same syntactic order:
  - Adverbial phrase, subject, verb, object, prepositional phrase


- There were two experimental conditions
  - SV agreement: 
      - Example: Por la noche el cantante graba una canción en el estudio.
  - SV disagreement: 
      - Example: Por la noche el cantante graba**n** una canción en el estudio. 


---
# Scoring

- The reading eye-tracking data had two types of data: picture data and reading data
  - Picture data measured sentence comprehension and verb bias
  - Reading data measured early and late processing of SV agreement/disagreement 
    - Gaze duration to the verb and total time spent on determiner, subject, and verb
- Raw reading data were converted into residual times


# Statistical Analyses 

- Reading data: both repeated and random effects were modeled
  - Repeated measures were assessed using a diagonal covariance structure (Agreement X Sentence ID = 64 parameters)
  - A random intercept for Subject was also included
- GLMM analyses for the reading data had Agreement, Tense, and Group, and all their possible interactions as fixed factors. 

---

# Results: Picture selection data

### Picture selection of grammatical sentences to measure reading comprehension

- All groups comprehended the sentences perfectly (lowest mean was 94.87%)


### Picture selection of ungrammatical sentences 

- No significant main effect for Tense, F(1,1002) = .663, p = .416, or Group, F(4,1002) = .690, p = .599, and no significant interaction, F(4,1002) = 1.351, p = .249. 
  - All groups preferred to choose the picture that corresponded to the first cue that they encountered vs the second 
  
---

# Results: Sentence reading data 

### Gaze on Verbs

- Significant main effect of Agreement, F(1,1803) = 13.402, p = .000 (incorrect &gt; correct)
- Significant interaction of Agreement and Group, F(4,1803) = 3.405, p = .009
  - Only monolinguals were sensitive to SV agreement violations

# Results (cont.): 

## Gaze on V+1

- No significant main effect or interaction
  - It was a determiner so determiners are easily skipped while reading 
  

## Gaze on V+2

- Main effect of Agreement, F(1,1606) = 5.019, p = .025 (incorrect &gt; correct)
  - Eventually all participants were sensitive!
  

---

# Results (cont.)

## Total time on determiners


- Significant main effect of Agreement, F(1,1165) = 14.289, p = .000
- Significant main effect of Group, F(4,1165) = 5.443, p = .000
  - S &gt; ES1; ES2 &gt; ES1

## Total time on verbs

- Significant main effect of Agreement, F(1,1803) = 54.705, p = .000 (incorrect&gt;correct)
- Significant interaction between Agreement and Group, F(4.1803) = 4.928, p = .001
  - All groups regressed longer to verbs in incorrect vs correct sentences
  - HS barely sensitive (p = .045)
- Significant main effect of Tense, F(1,1803) = 16.905, p = .000

# Discussion

- **Purpose:** investigate the effects of AoA and language experience on the processing of adjacent SV number agreement
- **How:** reading eye-tracking task 
- **Who:** low and high proficiency early and late bilinguals
- **Results:** suggest that HS and L2 learners behave similarly but not exactly the same as native speakers 

---

# Based on RQs

--

####  RQ1: Does AoA modulate or provide an advantage for HS over L2 learners processing of SV number agreement in Spanish? 

- Gaze on V + 2 support hypothesis that all participants would be sensitive to violations
- Findings support accessibility models 
  - Sensitivity to violation &amp; longer processing times (Sagarra &amp; Herschenshon, 2010; Romberg &amp; Saffran, 2010; Perani et al., 1998; Vingerhoets et al., 2003)
- HS were not superior to L2 learners, no AoA advantage
  - No differences in picture data, no significant differences in gaze duration 
  - Modality of the task could have been a disadvantage for the HS (Bowles, 2011; Montrul et al., 2008)

---

#### RQ2: Does proficiency modulate morphosyntactic processing patterns of SV number agreement?

- The hypothesis that proficiency modulates the processing of SV number agreement was partially supported 
  - Picture accuracy data: 
      - All groups behaved the same 
  - Sentence reading data: 
      - Total time on determiner shows that higher proficiency = more sensitivity (Sagarra &amp; Herschensohn, 2010; Jiang, 2004, 2007; Marinis, Roberts, Felser, &amp; Clahsen, 2005)
      - Gaze on verb shows delayed sensitivity, despite higher proficiency levels (Rodríguez &amp; Reglero, 2015; Sagarra &amp; Herschensohn, 2013; Perani et al., 1998; Vingerhoets et al., 2003)

---

# Conclusion

- The picture selection data: all groups comprehended meaning and relied more on S than V 
- The reading data: all groups were sensitive to the violations
  - Natives = sensitive earlier and to a larger extent 
- Overall, findings suggest HS and L2 learners behave similarly, but not identically, to native speakers
  - No advantage for acquiring the target language before puberty
